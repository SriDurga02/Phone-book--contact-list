Overview

The provided code is a Python script that implements a simple phonebook program. The program allows users to create, display, check, and delete contacts from a database.

Key Features

Establishes a connection to a MySQL database using the pymysql library
Provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the program
Allows users to create, display, check, and delete contacts from the database
Uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks
Functions

connect_db(): Establishes a connection to the MySQL database
welcome(): Displays a menu to the user and returns their input
display_contacts(): Retrieves and displays all contacts from the database
create_contact(): Creates a new contact in the database
check_entry(): Retrieves and displays a specific contact from the database
delete_contact(): Deletes a contact from the database
phonebook(): The main function that orchestrates the program's flow
Program Flow

The program establishes a database connection and enters an infinite loop, displaying the menu to the user and processing their input accordingly. The program exits when the user chooses to exit.

Conclusion

The phonebook program is a simple yet functional implementation of a contact management system. The code is well-organized, and the functions are clearly named and documented. However, the database connection parameters are hardcoded, which is not recommended for production environments.
